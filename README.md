![PhearJS](http://d3jtdrwnfjguwh.cloudfront.net/logo-red.svg) (0.5.0)

PhearJS renders webpages. It runs a server which supervises a set number of PhantomJS workers that do the actual parsing and evaluation.

Many websites rely on AJAX and front-end rendering. When a *machine* requests a page from such a website it sees a completely different page than you would see when viewing it in a browser.

This is a problem when you want to scrape such a website or create a static copy of your dynamic site for data mining or SEO purposes. PhearJS helps you with this, by rendering pages in a headless [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) browser and returning a JSON containing the rendered page and meta data about the response.

PhearJS was built and tested on Ubuntu 15.04, but should work on most Linux distributions. OSX reportedly works fine as well.

## Example

### Request

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9100? \
  fetch_url=http%3A%2F%2Fsuch-website.com"
```

### Response

``` json
{
  "success": true,
  "input_url": "http://such-website.com",
  "final_url": "http://www.such-website.com/",
  "request_headers": {},
  "response_headers": {
    "date": "Sun, 08 Feb 2015 15:11:22 GMT",
    "content-encoding": "gzip",
    "expires": "Sun, 08 Feb 2015 15:12:33 GMT",
    "vary": "Accept-Encoding",
    "cache-control": "max-age=60",
    "last-modified": "Sun, 08 Feb 2015 15:11:33 GMT",
    "content-type": "text/html; charset=utf-8"
  },
  "had_js_errors": false,
  "content": "<rendered HTML>"
}
```

## Installation, set-up and running

Check out [these instructions](INSTALLATION.md).

## Usage

Requests can be made to:

`http://localhost:9100?fetch_url=http%3A%2F%2Fdomain.com`

PhearJS accepts the following parameters:

- **fetch_url**=<*url-encoded-string*\> ***required***
  The URL to fetch, encoded as it would be by e.g. encodeURIComponent().

- **parse_delay**=<*milliseconds*\>
  Time to wait before returning, allowing scripts and AJAX calls to run.
  Default: *as set in config.json*.

- **force**=[*false*|*true*]
  Force a cache refresh.
  Default: *false*.

- **raw**=[*false*|*true*]
  Return the raw body instead of a JSON.
  Default: *false*.

- **get_requests**=[*false*|*true*]
  In the JSON, include all HTTP requests generated by the page.
  Default: *false*.

- **get_cookies**=[*false*|*true*]
  In the JSON, include all cookies generated by the page.
  Default: *false*.

- **headers**=<*URL-encoded JSON*\>
  Add additional headers to the request.
  Default: *{}*.

- **cache_namespace**=<*string*\>
  A namespace to use on the cache. Can be useful for multi-client settings.
  Default: *global-*.

### Status page

When PhearJS is running you can find a status page at `http://localhost:9100/status`. It
shows some stats about the running process. In production this status page should be enabled
via `config.json` and is password-protected through Basic Auth.
